Original NES Controller
===
If you can get a used one in good condition, definitely open it up and clean it.

This is the gold standard of the controllers.

The rubbers are sometimes mushy - clean them CAREFULLY with isopropyl 91%+ without breaking them.

My dpad has a little feel of uncertainty (not tactile like the buttons).
