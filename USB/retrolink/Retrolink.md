I bought two of these. One had dodgy buttons (A/B). Other was perfect.

Opening it up and comparing it to the OEM NES one, they were identical apart from PCB.
You can literally swap every part around.

I had an OEM NES controller with torn rubbers, so i swapped it with a Retrolink one.

Retrolink USB's look very authentic, even down to the yellowing on the plastic.

I will attempt to upload more pictures of the controller pcb etc in the future.
