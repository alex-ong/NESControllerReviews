RetroLink USB
===
Polling Rate - 16ms / 60hz (ideally 1000hz)

I bought two of these. One had dodgy buttons (A/B). Other was perfect - as good as an OEM Controller.

Opening it up and comparing it to the OEM NES one, they were identical apart from PCB.
You can literally swap every part around.

I had an OEM NES controller with torn rubbers, so i swapped it with a Retrolink one.

Retrolink USB's look very authentic, even down to the yellowing on the plastic.

I will attempt to upload more pictures of the controller pcb etc in the future.

Due to the polling rate, expect your inputs to be off by up to one frame. Remember that USB inputs
won't be polled exactly the same time as your emulator.
