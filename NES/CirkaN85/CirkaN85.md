This is the best repro NES Controller.

TL; DR:
On first testing, it had oversensitive diagonals. After opening it up a few times and closing it, it seems to have resolved itself.
I recommend swapping the rubbers for a thicker replacement.

The box comes in premium packaging.

It looks decent once you look at it.

A comparison to the real deal.

The rubbers are thinner and more flexible than the RetroLink. This makes them oversensitive and prone to hitting diagonals too easily.

The dpad has a bigger ball, making button presses deeper, and also easier to rock back and forth. 

The Dpad circle is slightly smaller, leading to some slop / inprecision when you press up followed by down, as the entire dpad slops physically.

When combined with the over-sensitive rubber, diagonals are frequrently misfired. Changing to a thicker rubber (Retrolink) fixed the problem.
