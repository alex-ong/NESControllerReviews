USB Polling Rate: Probably 1ms

Calculated internal polling rate: 1ms/1000hz

Total Latency: ~0-1ms (might be 16 if debouncing, but probably 1ms).

Internal polling rate is calculated by timing the minimum time delta between two key events.

Special thanks to MylesTheGreat for testing internal polling rate
