Six Dollar ebay controller

Polling rate: 40ms / 25hz (THIS IS TERRIBLE)

Due to the polling frame, expect your inputs to appear randomly 0-3 frames late. 

This makes it literally impossible to do anything frame perfect.
The casing is obscenely white.
Buttons are convex instead of concave.

The controller actually has a good feel to it. The dpad feels more tactile and less
mushy than the OEM one. Pressing arrows has a good feel of certainty.
The A/B buttons are fairly tactile.

Too bad despite the good feel, inputs are not at all registered correctly.
I wouldn't use this controller for anything apart from RPGs.

On Disassembly, none of the parts are compatible with an OEM NES.
