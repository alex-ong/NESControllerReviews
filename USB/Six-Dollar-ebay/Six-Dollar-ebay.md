Six Dollar ebay controller

Polling rate: 40ms / 25hz (THIS IS TERRIBLE)

Due to the polling frame, expect your inputs to appear randomly 0-3 frames late. 

This makes it literally impossible to do anything frame perfect.
The casing is obscenely white.

I wouldn't use this controller for anything apart from RPGs.

On Disassembly, none of the parts are compatible with an OEM NES.
