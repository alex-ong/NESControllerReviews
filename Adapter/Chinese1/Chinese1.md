The NES -> USB Conversion results in a keyboard input.
It sends WASD / KP3 / Backspace / Enter on the keyboard.

USB Polling Rate: TODO, probably 1ms

Calculated internal polling rate: 16ms/60hz

Total Latency: Probably Either 0ms-16ms or 16ms-32ms

Internal polling rate is calculated by timing the minimum time delta between two key events.
